As OnebyZero grows and expands its team, it is essential to reinforce our commitment to respectful and professional conduct at all times, both within the office and during any business or social events affiliated with OnebyZero.

We emphasize that all employees must treat each other with respect and maintain a courteous demeanor in all interactions, be it within the workplace or at sponsored outings. Any form of disrespectful, discriminatory, or offensive behavior is strictly prohibited and will not be tolerated.

At OnebyZero, consideration is a core value, and we strive to create a welcoming environment that embraces diversity, for all individuals to thrive. Additionally, we expect all employees, regardless of level, to be respectful and cordial when interacting with one another, whether individually or in group settings. 

We recognize the significance of data privacy and security. All employees are expected to handle sensitive company data responsibly and adhere to strict data protection measures. Data should be used solely for legitimate business purposes, and any unauthorized access or sharing of confidential information is strictly prohibited.

In addition, our company resources are vital assets that should be used responsibly and exclusively for work-related activities. Employees must avoid any misuse of company equipment, technology, and intellectual property.

As a team of top performers, we pride ourselves on professionalism and excellence. Our hiring process is designed to carefully select individuals who align with our values and uphold the highest standards of conduct.

If any employee witnesses or experiences behavior that violates our code of conduct, including inappropriate use of resources or data breaches, we encourage them to report it immediately to their supervisor and CC at least one senior manager (Anand Ranganathan `anand@onebyzero.ai`, Niket Vaidya `niket@onebyzero.ai` or Vibhore Kumar `vibhore@onebyzero.ai`). For those who wish to bypass their supervisor, direct communication with one or more senior managers is also available. Rest assured, all complaints will be handled promptly and confidentially.

By collectively embracing these principles, we cultivate an environment where every individual can thrive, knowing their privacy is respected, and their contributions are valued. Together, lets shape a company culture that promotes success, respect, and ethical behavior at every level of OnebyZero.
