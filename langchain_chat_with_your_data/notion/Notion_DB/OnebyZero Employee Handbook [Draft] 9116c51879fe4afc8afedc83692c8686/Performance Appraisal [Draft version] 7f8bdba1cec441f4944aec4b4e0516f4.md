# 📜 Performance Appraisal Process

- Every department lead should set KRA’s and goals for their teams. This process needs to be completed by Nov 15, 2023.
- KRA’s are measured annually, goals are reviewed monthly or quarterly.
- KRA’s and goals are supported by skills matrix and competencies. Every employee needs to have skills and competency milestones set for themselves after discussions with their managers. These will be reviewed periodically by the manager.
- The appraisal period is from January to December, and performance appraisal is conducted between January and March of the following year. (e.g. For the appraisal period of Jan-Dec 2024, performance appraisal will occur between Jan-Mar 2025) **[This will be done on Zoho People].**
- The first formal performance review will be conducted in Jan 2025.

# 🧐 Review Process

- The performance appraisal will be conducted along the following dimensions:
    1. **Main responsibility assessment**: Has the employee delivered on their responsibilities?
    2. **Quality assessment**: Has the employee been adhering to best practices & met targets set by their department?
        
        For Engineers: coding guidelines, testing, general pro-activeness on identifying problems and solving them.
        
        For Business folks: documentation standards, quality & promptness of communication, pro-activeness on identifying client issues and solving them.
        
    3. **Striving to improve assessment**: Has the employee been contributing their ideas, proposing enhancements and delivering them, as well as proactively seeking to improve their own work and the component being worked on, as well as the overall product they are helping to deliver?
    4. **Teamwork**: Has the employee been helpful to others and worked to establish good working relationships with their peers?
1. Company KRAs 
2. Department KRAs 
3. Manager KRAs
- In each of the above dimensions, there will be a qualitative assessment (one paragraph) and a quantitative score (given on a 3-point scale: Needs Improvement, Acceptable, Excellent). It will be assessed based on the following:
    1. **Self-evaluation**: The employee will provide their own qualitatively and quantitative assessment on the dimensions listed above. They will also provide their input on the following points: 
        
        (a) How can the company and its managers help me do a better job? 
        
        (b) How do I intend to improve myself professionally in the coming year? 
        
        (c) Optionally, provide feedback for one or more of your colleagues who has done an outstanding job in your view and explain why.
        
    2. **Evaluation by at least two of the senior managers**: Each senior manager will provide their own assessment along the dimensions above.
    3. **Manager feedback:** The direct manager will provide *concrete* feedback on ideas in areas where the employee can improve and what they can specifically do to reach their next career milestone.
    4. **Face to face meetings**: The senior managers will compile these assessments into a final report where there will be a quantitative score and a summary of the assessments to be shared with the employees.
    
    The report will be used to determine bonus, raise and promotion eligibility, which will also be communicated to the employee in a face-to-face meeting with the employee.
    

# 📝 Criteria for Bonus, Raise or Promotion

- Considering the 12-point score (3 dimensions and a 3-point scale), the employees will be rated according to 4 groups:
    - Outstanding (>11): Employees at this level will be eligible for promotion, upon a recommendation of two of more senior managers. In other words, the employee may be promoted, but that won't occur automatically (see Criteria for Promotion).
    - Above Expectations (9-10): Employees at this level will be eligible for both bonus and raises, proportional to their numeric score. In other words, a higher score implies in higher bonus and raise (see Bonus and Raise Levels).
    - Meets Expectations (8): Employees at this level and above will be eligible for a COLA (cost of living adjustment) raise on their base pay. The level of the COLA raise will be set by the CFO and be based on the inflation rate of the country where the employee is located.
    - Below Expectations (<8): A rating of "Below expectations" will place the employee under probation, with a closer monitoring during the next year appraisal cycle. A Below Expectations rating for two consecutive performance appraisal cycles will likely result in the dismissal of the employee.

# 💰 Bonus and Raise Levels

- A department-wise bonus percentage (BP) and raise percentage (RP) will be calculated based on the overall performance of 1/0 and the department.
    
    
    | Employee score | Bonus
    (% over gross annual pay) | Raise
    (% over gross annual pay) |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Outstanding | 1.0 x BP | 1.0 x BP |
    | Above expectations | 0.5 x RP | 0.5 x RP |

# Criteria for Promotion?

- Employees become eligible once 2 or more senior managers agree that the employee is performing at their next level. For reference, here is a table summarizing the existing software engineering bands at OneByZero:
    
    
    | Bands | Criteria at hiring | Number of grades | Expected salary bump
    % over gross pay |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | Principal Software Engineer | BSc 10+ years of experience / MSc 6+ years of experience / PhD | 3 | Each level represents a 2% bump over the prior level |
    | Senior Staff Software Engineer | BSc [5, 10] years of experience / MSc 3+ years of experience | 3 | Each level represents a 2% bump over the prior level |
    | Staff Software Engineer | BSc [0, 5] years of experience / MSc | 3 | Each level represents a 3% bump over the prior level |
    
    There are two possible types of promotions:
    
    **In-band**: An employee remains in the same band but moves up one grade, e.g., a Staff Software Engineer I is promoted to Staff Software Engineer II.
    
    **Up-one-band**: An employee moves up one band, e.g., a Staff Software Engineer II is promoted to Principal Software Engineer I.
    
    In general, the expectation is that employees will climb on grade every two years. In exceptional cases, a multiple grade jump will be possible based on the (outstanding) performance assessment of an employee.
    
    The expected in-band raises when switching from one grade to the next is stated in the column "Expected salary bump" in the table above.
    
    The up-one-band raise will imply a 10% increase on the employee's current salary.
    

# What's an example of the financial rewards reaped by an employee?

On the high end, an employee, Jane Developer, that has had an outstanding year, earning the highest performance appraisal skill, who is also going to be promoted will accrue the following benefits:

An outstanding rating means that Jane Developer will get a one-time bonus of 15% of her current gross annual salary.

For the upcoming year, she will get a COLA adjustment (if applicable), a 6% raise (due to her performance review score) and, if she is also being promoted up one band, she will get a 10% bump (corresponding to the next band).
