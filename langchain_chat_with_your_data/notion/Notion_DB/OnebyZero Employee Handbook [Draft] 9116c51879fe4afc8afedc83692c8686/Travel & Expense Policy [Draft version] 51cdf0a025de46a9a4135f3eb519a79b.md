# 🧳 Travel

- Employees must submit a travel request on **Zoho People [for travel req and travel exp]**, at least 14 days in advance to ensure we get the best rates. Any unapproved travel bookings will not be reimbursed.
    
    ✈️ **Fares**: Fly Economy. Plan your trip ahead of time, so we get the benefit of reasonable prices. Your ticket should be within 10% of the cheapest alternative available. 
    
    🛂 **Visa Fees**: Will be paid at actuals against receipts.
    
    ⛑️ **Insurance**: You may purchase a travel insurance from any local insurer for your trip before you travel. Do not opt in for travel insurance from the airline, because they won’t cover you for the full trip. Keep the receipt.
    
    🏨 **Hotels**: Book a reasonably priced hotel (upto $100/ night). If you are staying in one location more than 7 days, book a serviced apartment instead of a hotel. Share rooms where possible. Please book hotels with breakfast and with Internet access included. 
    
    💵 **Per Diems**: are payable when you leave your home location to any other destination on work. Our per diems are above what the industry pays. This is in order to make you comfortable and ensure that we are not out of pocket for expenses we incur when we travel. You will be paid basis the # of nights stayed + 1 day. If you feel that you did not spend as much, or were hosted by a peer, you can claim 50% or deduct your per diem for that period from your claim. Use your judgement. The numbers below are guidelines and change from year to year, please confirm them with your supervisor.
