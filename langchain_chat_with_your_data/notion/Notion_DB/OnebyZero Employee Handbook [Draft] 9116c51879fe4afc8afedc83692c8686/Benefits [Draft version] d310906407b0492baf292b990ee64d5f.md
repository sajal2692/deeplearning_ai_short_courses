üè† Flexible Working: Employees are required to be in office 3 days a week. We leave it up to each country to decide the work-from-home and work-from-office days. 

üåç Remote Working: For 2 weeks each year, employees can work remotely from anywhere in the world. Please work with your manager if you‚Äôve chosen a location in a different timezone and provide 3 weeks notice to your manager and team.

üéì Learning: 

- Required Certifications: OneByZero will only pay for 1 failed certification in a year. In case of a failed certification, the employee will be reimbursed only when they undertake the same certification again and pass the same. In this case, they will be reimbursed for 2 certifications upon passing. If an employee fails, they are not eligible to take any other certification unless they pass the same certification (or an exception is approved). If an employee fails more than 1 certification in a year, they might be put on a performance improvement plan.
